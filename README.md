I find Chinese characters very interesting. When travelling in China, I found myself looking at different characters and seeing the similarities, the radicals that appear in different characters, and the fact that one character can be transformed into another by adding or removing a component.

This app allows users to explore Chinese characters by playing with components in exactly this way. The project was created in order for me to develop my front-end dev skills.

To use the app, clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The database is generated using publicly available data from:
- [cjkvi](https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids?tab=readme-ov-file) for decomposition
- [Chinese language database](https://areyde.com/chinese/) for pronunciation, meaning etc.
